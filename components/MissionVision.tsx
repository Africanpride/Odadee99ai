          Presec was officially opened on 1 February 1938 with 10 students and 4
          teachers in Odumase Krobo in the eastern region of Ghana and moved to
          its current location in Accra in 1968. From a humble beginning, the
          school has now grown to become the most preferred high school in
          Ghana, particularly for STEM programs. The school also offers business
          and art programs. As of the 2023 academic year, the school had 5,473
          students and 238 teaching staff. Discipline, moral uprightness and
          academic excellence continue to be the schoolâ€™s hallmark.
